River Song's timeline - open sourced!

## Notes #
This is a work in progress. Feel free to submit an issue or pull request changes if I've got something wrong!
If you think this would be better represented in a language, XML or something, submit an issue proposing the format - I think it would be cool but I'm not sure what would be suitable?
